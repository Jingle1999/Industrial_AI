# Agentic Orchestration

**Concept Area:** Agentic Systems & Multi-Agent Coordination  
**Key Influences:** MAS, LLM Agents, Workflow Orchestration

---

## Summary

Agentic orchestration refers to structuring intelligence as **multiple specialized agents** that:
- Have distinct roles
- Coordinate via protocols
- Collaborate toward shared objectives

Modern agentic orchestration often uses:
- Role-based agents
- Planning + tool use
- Hierarchical or federated control

---

## Industrial AI Relevance

Agentic orchestration maps well to industrial realities:
- Multiple subsystems
- Heterogeneous time scales
- Distributed decision authority

Examples:
- Scheduler agent
- Optimization agent
- Monitoring agent
- Human-override agent

---

## Industrial AI Lens

✅ Advantages:
- Modularity
- Fault isolation
- Scalable autonomy

⚠️ Risks:
- Emergent behavior
- Coordination failure
- Latency and deadlocks

➡️ Industrial AI requires **explicit authority boundaries, arbitration, and fail-safe supervisors**.
