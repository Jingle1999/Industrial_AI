# Papers

## Purpose

This section collects **foundational and forward-looking research papers** relevant to Industrial AI.

The goal is **not volume**, but **conceptual leverage**:
papers that change how we think about intelligence, autonomy, orchestration, and learning in physical, industrial systems.

---

## What belongs here

- Academic papers (peer-reviewed or preprint)
- Foundational theory (e.g. world models, reinforcement learning, agentic systems)
- Papers with *architectural implications* for industry
- Research that bridges AI and physical systems

Examples:
- Autotelic Reinforcement Learning
- World Models & Predictive Coding
- Agentic Orchestration
- Cognitive Digital Twins
- Edge-native intelligence

---

## What does NOT belong here

- Generic ML benchmark papers
- Model comparison leaderboards
- Papers without clear relevance to industrial decision-making
- Vendor whitepapers disguised as research

---

## How papers are handled

Each paper should be accompanied by:
- a short summary (1–2 paragraphs)
- the key insight for Industrial AI
- implications for architecture, governance, or orchestration
- open questions

This turns papers into **thinking tools**, not passive references.

---

## Why this matters

Industrial AI advances less through better models
and more through **better mental models**.

This section exists to sharpen those.
