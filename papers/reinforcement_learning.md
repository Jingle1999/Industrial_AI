## Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

**Title:** Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: Survey  
**Authors:** Andrew G. Barto et al.  
**Year:** 2003  
**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022676722315

**Why it matters for Industrial AI**
- Matches multi-timescale industrial processes
- Enables separation of planning vs control
- Reduces sample complexity

## Temporal Abstraction

**Title:** Temporal Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning  
**Authors:** Sutton, Precup, Singh  
**Year:** 1999  
**Link:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370299000521

**Industrial relevance**
- Aligns with batch processes, maintenance cycles, and scheduling
- Avoids millisecond-level overfitting

## Autotelic Reinforcement Learning

**Title:** Autotelic Reinforcement Learning  
**Authors:** Colas et al.  
**Year:** 2020  
**arXiv:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08406

**Industrial relevance**
- Intrinsic motivation useful for simulation-driven learning
- Risky without constraints → must be combined with safety layers
