# Edge-Native Intelligence

**Concept Area:** Edge AI, Embedded Intelligence, Cyber-Physical Systems

---

## Summary

Edge-native intelligence refers to AI systems designed **from the ground up** to operate:
- Close to physical processes
- With low latency
- Under limited compute and connectivity

Unlike cloud-first AI, edge-native systems assume:
- Intermittent connectivity
- Hard real-time constraints
- Safety-critical operation

---

## Industrial AI Relevance

Most industrial intelligence must live at the edge:
- Controllers
- Robots
- Machines
- Sensors

Cloud AI is advisory; edge AI is operational.

## Industrial AI Lens

✅ Strengths:
- Deterministic behavior
- Low latency
- Increased robustness

⚠️ Constraints:
- Limited model size
- Update complexity
- Verification requirements

➡️ Industrial AI is **edge-first by necessity**, cloud-second by convenience.
