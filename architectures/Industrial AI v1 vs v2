# Industrial AI v1 vs Industrial AI v2

This document summarizes the evolution from classical Industrial AI (v1) toward modern, agentic, intent-driven Industrial AI (v2).

The comparison is based on a layered view of industrial systems, spanning OT, MES, ERP, and AI decision layers.

---

## Industrial AI v1 — Data-Driven Automation

### Core Characteristics
Industrial AI v1 is primarily **data-driven**, retrospective, and analytics-focused.

- Centralized data collection
- Batch-oriented analytics
- Optimization after the fact
- Dashboards as the primary interface
- Limited or no runtime decision authority

### Typical Architecture
- **Data Sources**
  - PLC / SCADA
  - Historians
  - MES execution data
  - ERP / Finance systems

- **Analytics Layers**
  - OT analytics (alarms, signals, machine events)
  - MES analytics (OEE, downtime, yield)
  - ERP analytics (orders, margins, supply risks)

- **Outputs**
  - Reports
  - Dashboards
  - Alerts
  - Predictive insights (often offline)

### Limitations
- Decisions remain human-driven
- AI explains *what happened*, not *what should happen*
- No closed-loop execution
- Poor handling of real-time disturbances
- Optimization without governance can increase risk

## Industrial AI v2 — Intent-Driven, Agentic Systems

### Core Characteristics
Industrial AI v2 is **decision-centric**, real-time, and governed.

- Intent-driven instead of data-driven
- Decisions happen close to the source
- Agents act with bounded authority
- Continuous execution and adaptation
- Governance and traceability built-in

---

## Key Architectural Shift

### Context Layer (New Core Element)
Industrial AI v2 introduces a **Context Layer** as semantic glue across OT, MES, and ERP.

The context layer provides:
- Asset models
- Tag dictionaries
- Work order and batch context
- Genealogy and quality context
- Business context (costs, SLAs, priorities)

This layer turns raw data into *decision-ready state*.

## Industrial AI Agent Layer

On top of the context layer operates the **Industrial AI Agent Layer**, consisting of specialized agents:

- **RCA Agents**  
  Explain *why* something happened

- **Playbook Agents**  
  Recommend or execute predefined recovery actions

- **Impact Agents**  
  Evaluate business, quality, and delivery impact

- **Optimization Agents**  
  Improve performance within governed boundaries

### Key Difference to v1
Agents do not just analyze — they:
- Decide
- Act
- Escalate
- Learn

All actions are:
- Traceable
- Governed
- Auditable

## Execution Model Comparison

| Aspect | Industrial AI v1 | Industrial AI v2 |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Driver | Data | Intent |
| Timing | Retrospective | Real-time |
| Control | Human-in-the-loop | Human-on-the-loop |
| AI Role | Analytics | Decision & Execution |
| Governance | Weak / External | Built-in |
| Learning | Model retraining | Decision memory |
| Risk Handling | After the fact | Preventive & bounded |

---

## Why This Matters

Industrial AI v2 enables:
- Cognitive Digital Twins (not just simulations)
- Closed-loop control with safety guarantees
- Scalable autonomy without loss of trust
- Alignment of shopfloor actions with business intent

It shifts industry from:
> "Optimizing data"  
to  
> "Operating decisions"

---

## Key Takeaway

Industrial AI v2 is not about more data or better dashboards.

It is about:
- **How decisions are made**
- **Where decisions are made**
- **Who (or what) is allowed to act**
- **Under which governance constraints**

This transition marks the move from automation to cognition in industrial systems.
