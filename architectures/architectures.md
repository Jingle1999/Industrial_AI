# Architectures

## Purpose

This section describes **reference architectures for Industrial AI systems**.

The focus is on:
- system-level design
- interaction between agents, humans, and machines
- governance and control
- decision flow rather than data flow

Architectures here are **conceptual and structural**, not tied to specific vendors or frameworks.

---

## What belongs here

- Agentic system architectures
- Cognitive Digital Twin architectures
- Edge / cloud split patterns
- Governance-first system designs
- Orchestration and authority models

Examples:
- Agentic OS for industrial environments
- Decision-centric system architectures
- Governance and escalation layers
- Multi-agent coordination patterns

---

## What does NOT belong here

- Framework tutorials
- Tool-specific setups
- Code-level optimizations
- Vendor-specific reference stacks

---

## Guiding principle

> Models reason.  
> Architectures decide.

Industrial AI succeeds or fails at the architectural level —
long before any model is deployed.

---

## Expected outcome

A reader should leave this section with:
- a clearer mental model of industrial AI systems
- an understanding of trade-offs
- the ability to reason about autonomy, safety, and scale
