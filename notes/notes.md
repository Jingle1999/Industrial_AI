# Notes

## Purpose

This section captures **thinking in progress**.

It is intentionally informal, exploratory, and reflective.
Not everything here is correct — but everything here is honest.

---

## What belongs here

- Research notes
- Reflections on papers and articles
- Open questions
- Hypotheses and mental models
- Observations from industry experience

Examples:
- “What I learned from Autotelic AI”
- “Why Big Data metaphors break down in factories”
- “Open questions about agent authority”
- “Notes after reading X or observing Y”

---

## What does NOT belong here

- Polished conclusions
- Final architectures
- Marketing-ready text

Those belong elsewhere.

---

## Why this matters

Industrial AI is still forming.

Progress comes from:
- reflection
- iteration
- intellectual honesty

This section documents that journey.

## Guiding principle

> Think slowly.  
> Write clearly.  
> Change your mind when reality disagrees.
