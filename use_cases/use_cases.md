# Use Cases

## Purpose

This section grounds Industrial AI in **real, physical industrial scenarios**.

Use cases demonstrate how agentic, governed AI systems operate
under real-world constraints:
- safety
- quality
- timing
- responsibility

---

## What belongs here

- Manufacturing and production scenarios
- Automotive, bodyshop, BIW, assembly examples
- Scheduling, quality, maintenance, logistics
- Highly anonymized, OEM-neutral descriptions

Examples:
- Doorline production in bodyshop
- Quality gates and rework prevention
- Adaptive production scheduling
- Maintenance and fault recovery

---

## How use cases are structured

Each use case should describe:
1. Physical process (what actually happens)
2. Decision points
3. Agent roles and responsibilities
4. Required sensor inputs (at the source)
5. Governance and escalation rules
6. Expected outcomes and limits

---

## What does NOT belong here

- Generic business cases
- ROI-only narratives
- Marketing success stories
- Unrealistic “fully autonomous” fantasies

---

## Why this matters

Industrial AI only earns trust
when it proves itself **inside real processes**.

Use cases are where theory meets steel.
